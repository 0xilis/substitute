 * This can be used to 'hook' functions or even exported variables.  Compared
 * to substitute_hook_functions, it has the following advantages:
 *
 * - It does not require the ability to patch executable code; accordingly, it
 *   can (from a technical rather than policy perspective) be used in sandboxed
 *   environments like iOS or PaX MPROTECT.
 * - On platforms without RELRO or similar, it is thread safe, as the patches
 *   are done using atomic instructions.
 * - It does not require architecture specific code.
 * - It can be used to modify a single library's view of the world without
 *   affecting the rest of the program.
 *
 * ...and the following disadvantages:
 *
 * - It only works for exported functions, and even then will not catch calls
 *   from a library to its own exported functions.
 * - At present, it *only* works for a single importing library at a time.
 *   Although it is not difficult on most platforms to iterate loaded libraries
 *   in order to hook all of them, substitute does not currently provide this
 *   functionality, traversing all libraries' symbol tables may be slow, and in
 *   any case there is the matter of new importers being loaded after the fact.
 *
 * @handle   handle of the importing library
 * @hooks    see struct substitute_import_hook
 * @nhooks   number of hooks
 * @options  options - pass 0.
 * @return   SUBSTITUTE_OK
